# Intelligent-Garbage-Classifcation-Using-Deep-Learning
The Garbage Classification Using Deep Learning project is an innovative web 

application that utilizes state-of-the-art deep learning techniques to classify images 

of garbage into specific categories. The main objective of this project is to contribute 

to waste management and environmental conservation efforts by providing an 

efficient and user-friendly tool for waste classification.

Waste management is a critical global issue, and improper disposal of waste can 

have severe environmental consequences. To address this problem, accurate waste 

classification is essential, as it allows for effective recycling, reuse, and proper 

disposal of waste materials. However, manual waste classification can be time-

consuming and error-prone.

This web application leverages the power of deep learning to automate the waste 

classification process. The underlying deep learning model has been trained on a 

diverse dataset of garbage images, allowing it to identify different types of waste 

materials accurately. By providing users with an intuitive interface to upload images 

of garbage, the web app quickly classifies the waste into categories such as 

cardboard, glass, metal, paper, plastic, and trash.
